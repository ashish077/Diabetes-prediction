# Diabetes-prediction
- Built a Diabetes prediction model using logistic regression from scratch. Evaluated its performance using precision and accuracy score. 
- Built a neural network model using keras. Explored its performance using various regularizers like l1, l2 and droupout and compared the performance of the model 
using precision and accuracy score.
